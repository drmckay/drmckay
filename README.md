  </p><p>I'm Peter, I am working as a penetration tester with more than 14 years experience. I decided to start using GitHub more oftenly to release some of my tools and/or solutions, which I wrote for learning purposes. Hopefully you will find it useful. My primary focus is Red Teaming but I'm also encouraged with Industrial Penetration Testing too. The released codes are written in my own free time, whenever my beloved kids are not playing with the keyboard. xD
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm a holder of following cybersecurity/IT certificates: CRTO (from ZeroPoint), OSCP, OSCE, OSWP, CSSA.
